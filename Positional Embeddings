                     Positional Embeddings

Positional embeddings are the vectors added to token embeddings in Transformer models to indicate the position of each token in a sequence.They are essential becuase transformers process all tokens in paralle and dont inherently encode word order,unline RNN
For every token in an input sequence (e.g., "Sarah", "went", ...), an embedding representing its position (such as first, second, third, etc.) is generated

OF transformer model has a stack of six Encoder blocks
because of six blocks we face two problems

Why Normalization?
-->operates on the activations of a neural network to ensure their values have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one across the features for each sample
what if we didnt use?
-->Models will likely suffer from interval covariate shift,exploding/vanishing gradients,decreased genralization and slower convergence

Why layer Normalization?
-->It normalizes acroos the features of each individual sample not across the batch like batch ormalization.

Skip Connections?
(residual connection) in neural networks is a shortcut pathway that directly adds the input of a layer (or block) to its output, bypassing one or more intermediate layers.​

Layer i ----> Layer j ----> Layer k
          |              |
          x              J(x)+x

Benefits:
1.)Gradient Flow
2.)Identity mapping
3.) Faster and More stable  Training 
For Ex:
If the input to a block is x and the output is F(x),the skip connetions
