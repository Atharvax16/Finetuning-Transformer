Example:
"Sarah went to a restaurant to meet her friend that night"

Over here the word "sarah" relates to other words in diffrent ways:
What did sarah do?to meet
where did sarah go?to restaurant 
who did sarah meet?her friend
when did the sarah go?at night 

Self-Attention focuses on only one aspect of the sentence, but there is many others therefore we need to have separate self-attentions for each aspect,that lead to multi-head self Attention mechanism where each head focus on one such aspect.
One head may focus on the relationship between “Sarah” and “her friend,” learning about who is meeting whom.​
Another head might pay attention to “restaurant” and “night,” helping the model capture the time and location context.​
Another head could attend to “went” and “restaurant” to understand the action and destination pairing.

1.)The input embeddings (from tokenization) are passed to each head in parallel.
2.)For example, "Sarah" and "friend" are processed by different attention heads, each projecting the inputs into separate query, key, and value spaces using distinct weight matrices.​
3.)Each head calculates attention scores for every token pair using the dot product of the query (Q) and key (K) vectors for those tokens.​
4.)These scores are passed through a softmax function, converting them to attention weights.
5.)The attention weights are then used to compute a weighted sum (linear combination) of the value (V) vectors, producing the output for each token and head.​
6.)Outputs from all heads are concatenated and further processed, enabling the model to learn complex, parallel relationships among tokens.

Dimensions -> It refers to the size of the vectors at different stages in the model.
1.Embedding Dimension
This is the size of the input vectors after tokenization and embedding lookup.
For example, if the embedding dimension is 512, each token is represented by a 512-dimensional vector
2.Head Dimension
In multi-head attention, the embedding dimension is split across several heads.
For H heads, each head works with vectors of size
3.Query Key,Value Dimension
4.Output Dimension
