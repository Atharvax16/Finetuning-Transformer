Example:
"Sarah went to a restaurant to meet her friend that night"

Over here the word "sarah" relates to other words in diffrent ways:
What did sarah do?to meet
where did sarah go?to restaurant 
who did sarah meet?her friend
when did the sarah go?at night 

Self-Attention focuses on only one aspect of the sentence, but there is many others therefore we need to have separate self-attentions for each aspect,that lead to multi-head self Attention mechanism where each head focus on one such aspect.
One head may focus on the relationship between “Sarah” and “her friend,” learning about who is meeting whom.​
Another head might pay attention to “restaurant” and “night,” helping the model capture the time and location context.​
Another head could attend to “went” and “restaurant” to understand the action and destination pairing.
