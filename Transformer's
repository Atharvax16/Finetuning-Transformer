What is Transformer?
It's basically an encoder-decoder architecture used for parallel_processing and self attention mechanisms

Encoder->
Multi-head Attention->Add & Norm->Feed Forward->Add & Norm

Decoder->
Masked multi-head Attention->add & norm ->multi-head Attention->add& norm feed forward ->add & norm --> linear ->Softmax
